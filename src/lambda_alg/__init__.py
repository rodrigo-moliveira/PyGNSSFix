"""
This module contains the Python implementation of the LAMBDA method for GNSS ambiguity resolution.

This implementation is based on:
# (c) Mathematical Geodesy and Positioning, Delft University of Technology
# Original Author: Dimitrios Psychas (Python Version 1.0, 2019)
# Source: Python port of the Matlab LAMBDA software package (Version 3.0)
# Developed under supervision of Bofeng Li and Sandra Verhagen
# Original research by Teunissen (1993), De Jonge & Tiberius (1996), and others

Disclaimer:
All credits for the original algorithm and Matlab code go to the GNSS Research Centre
and the Mathematical Geodesy and Positioning group at Delft University of Technology.
This Python version is a functional replica of the Matlab LAMBDA Version 3.0,
developed to support GNSS software development in Python.

Note:
The core structure of the original implementation has been preserved. Consequently,
this module may not follow the full architecture (naming conventions, docstrings, etc.)
of the surrounding project, in order to ensure algorithmic fidelity and maintainability.

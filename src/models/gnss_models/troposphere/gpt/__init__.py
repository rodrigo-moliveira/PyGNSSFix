# This troposphere model has been adapted from the reference above
# Disclaimer: All credits for the original code go to the Department of Geodesy and Geoinformation,

# I made the decision of keeping the code as is, minimizing the amount of fixes and code adaptation
# As a consequence, this module does not follow the architecture (naming conventions, docstrings, etc.)

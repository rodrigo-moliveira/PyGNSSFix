| Specialties in    | - CODE has been generating its products from a        |
| CODE's analysis   |   rigorous combination of GPS and GLONASS (in rapid   |
|                   |   and ultra-rapid chains even including Galileo)      |
|                   |   observations. In this way, best possible            |
|                   |   consistency of the orbit products is guaranteed.    |
|                   | - Uninterrupted POD for all transmitting GNSS         |
|                   |   satellites, specifically for:                       |
|                   |   . brand new satellites                              |
|                   |   . satellites without any broadcast orbit information|
|                   |   . satellites marked unhealthy/unusable              |
|                   |   . poorly observed (GLONASS) satellites              |
|                   |   . (GPS) satellites being repositioned               |
|                   | - Elevation mask angle of 3 degrees used.             |
|                   | - Sophisticated ambiguity resolution scheme, already  |
|                   |   including GLONASS ambiguity resolution (with        |
|                   |   restrictions, specifically for baseline lengths     |
|                   |   longer than 200 km), self-calibrating for GLONASS.  |
|                   | - Ambiguity verification scheme: resolved ambiguities |
|                   |   are checked in terms of compatibility, also in order|
|                   |   to detect unexpected quarter-cycle issues.          |
|                   | - GPS quarter-cycle phase bias issue: potentially     |
|                   |   affected GPS ambiguities are banned from ambiguity  |
|                   |   resolution.                                         |
|                   | - Continuous parametrization, particularly for EOP,   |
|                   |   troposphere ZPD and horizontal gradient parameters, |
|                   |   ionosphere parameters, allowing for connection of   |
|                   |   the parameters at day boundaries.                   |
|                   | - For the three-day long-arc final solution the       |
|                   |   continuity is only realized via constraints keeping |
|                   |   the realted parameters independent, in particular   |
|                   |   SINEX file generation (compatibility to one-day     |
|                   |   solutions from other analysis centers).             |
|                   | - IGS fiducial sites are automatically verified for   |
|                   |   consistent datum definition for final, rapid, and   |
|                   |   even the ultra-rapid processing. This is also true  |
|                   |   with respect to all antenna-sharing fiducial sites. |
|                   | - Inclusion of fast moving South Pole station AMU2.   |
|                   | - Inclusion of all available NGA stations.            |
|                   | - Generation of high-rate (5-sec) clock products.     |
|                   | - Generation of high-rate (1-hour) EOP results        |
|                   |   (internally).                                       |
|                   | - Setup of GNSS satellite antenna PCV parameters      |
|                   |   specific to each individual GPS, GLONASS and Galileo|
|                   |   satellite; corresponding patterns are not only      |
|                   |   available for the ionosphere-free linear            |
|                   |   combination but also for the geometry-free (L1-L2)  |
|                   |   linear combination.                                 |
|                   | - A multi-GNSS-capable internal PCV file format is    |
|                   |   used; receiver antenna PCV models specific to       |
|                   |   GLONASS (or other) frequencies are applied.         |
|                   | - 3 terms of higher-order ionosphere (HOI) effects are|
|                   |   taken into account (based on CODE GIM & IGRF11SYN). |
|                   |   Scaling factor for 2nd and 3rd order HOI as well as |
|                   |   for ray bending for validation purposes and to      |
|                   |   switch the parameter on or off                      |
|                   | - Atmospheric non-tidal pressure loading correction   |
|                   |   at observation level with scaling factors to obtain |
|                   |   solutions without applying such corrections         |
|                   | - Monitoring of various differential code biases      |
|                   |   (DCBs), specifically:                               |
|                   |   . GPS/GLONASS P1-P2 satellite and receiver DCBs     |
|                   |   . GPS/GLONASS P1-C1 and P2-C2 satellite DCBs        |
|                   |   . biases crucial for GLONASS ambiguity resolution   |
|                   |   Values are extracted from different data processing |
|                   |   steps and directly from the RINEX observation files |
|                   |   (where possible)                                    |
|                   | - Extensive monitoring of IGS data flow concerning:   |

|                   |   imported and re-introduced. First extracted and     |
|                   |   secondly re-produced station coordinate results are |
|                   |   cross-checked to the original analysis results (at  |
|                   |   0.01-mm level). The extracted list of fiducial      |
|                   |   stations is used for this re-production.            |
|                   | - Provision of GNSS geocenter coordinates in SINEX.   |
|                   | - Production of GNSS rapid SINEX files containing     |
|                   |   station coordinates and ERPs with a time resolution |
|                   |   of 6 hours is foreseen as a contribution for the    |
|                   |   IERS inter-technique combination.                   |
